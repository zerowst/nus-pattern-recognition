# These are the files of CA2 of EE5907 Pattern Recognition.

The implementation of these algorithms PCA, LDA, SVM, CNN are stored in four files with corresponding name 
respectively. 

The folder PIE is the image file. The selfie images are stored in folder '0', the rest of folders are CMU images.

For PCA.ipynb, LDA.ipynb, SVM.ipynb files, just open them with jupyter notebook and run them.

For CNN file, I programmed it with Google Colab. Therefore, if you want to run it, just put this file into your Google
drive space and open it with Colab. Besides, the text_x, text_y, train_x, train_y are four data files that you are required
to put into your Google Drive space with the same path of CNN.ipynb.
